I am currently on the Llama team at Meta Gen AI.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University working with <a href="https://thashim.github.io/" target="_blank">Tatsu Hashimoto</a> and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/" target="_blank">Percy Liang</a>. Before that I completed my PhD at UC Berkeley advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/" target="_blank">Peter Bartlett</a>, and graduated from IIT Bombay in 2015.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Statistics. My current research interests center around building more robust language models. In the past, I have worked on interpolating models, optimization theory, online learning, and MCMC algorithms.
