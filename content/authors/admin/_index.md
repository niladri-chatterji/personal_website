I am a fifth year PhD student advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/" target="_blank">Peter Bartlett</a> and Michael DeWeese. I am associated with the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research group (BAIR). My research interests lie at the intersection of Theoretical Statistics and Machine Learning. Some areas I am interested in and have worked on in the past include, Monte Carlo methods, optimization guarantees for structured non-convex problems and Online learning with partial information (bandit feedback).

I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay with a dual degree B.Tech+M.Tech in Engineering Physics.
