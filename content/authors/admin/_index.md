I am a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. I am associated with the Stanford Statistical Artificial Intelligence Research group and am advised by <a href="https://thashim.github.io/" target="_blank">Tatsu Hashimoto</a> and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/" target="_blank">Percy Liang</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of Theoretical Statistics and Machine Learning. Some areas I am interested in and have worked on in the past include, understanding the generalization ability of interpolating models, Monte Carlo methods, optimization guarantees for structured non-convex problems and online learning with partial information (bandit feedback).

Previously I spend six wonderful years at UC Berkeley advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/" target="_blank">Peter Bartlett</a>. Before that I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in 2015 with a dual degree B.Tech+M.Tech in Engineering Physics.
