(I am currently on the job market!)

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. I am associated with the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab and work with <a href="https://thashim.github.io/" target="_blank">Tatsu Hashimoto</a> and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/" target="_blank">Percy Liang</a>. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Statistics. My current research interests center around building a theory to understand and improve neural network models. Many neural network models generalize well despite perfectly fitting noisy training data; I am interested in understanding what leads to successful generalization and optimization. I also develop techniques to make neural networks robust and think about optimal model selection for neural networks.

Some areas I have worked on in the past include Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, optimization for structured non-convex problems, and online learning.


Previously I spent six wonderful years at UC Berkeley advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/" target="_blank">Peter Bartlett</a>. Before that, I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in 2015 with a dual degree B.Tech+M.Tech in Engineering Physics.
